I am a graduated PhD under Alibaba Talent Program and conduct research on machine learning related urban computing (client trajectory modeling, human Spatial Temporal data, time series data modeling) and data mining, experienced on CNN, LSTM, transformer, diffusion and generative models, graph neural network and other machine learning or LLM/RAG related modeling tasks. 
- Proficient in Python, Linux and Pytorch related AI and machine learning framework.
- Taken post-graduate courses such as Machine Learning for Data Science, Data Mining, Information Retrieval, Deep Learning in NLP, Numerical Algorithm and so on in NTU. 
- Designed novel deep learning models in Python and Pytorch to proficiently model spatial temporal trajectory data. Implemented vehicle trajectory models utilizing dual transformer architecture and multi-task learning strategy, achieving high prediction accuracy of above 95%.

I received my Ph.D degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore in 2024, supervised by Prof. [Cheng Long](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/c.long/). I received my B.S. degree (Honours) in Electrical Engineering from National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2015, and master degree in Management of Technology (MOT) from National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore in 2019.
